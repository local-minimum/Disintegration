I should have recorded this much sooner. There was no time, there's still no
good time. Fact, shit only gets worse by the minute and I know my parents would
be furious with this. Fuck them, what choice do I have? I'm logging this into
my bootleg private storage. The stuff they don't know about me. A dirty little
secret, it's my secret. If they find it, it's not like it's illegal to keep secrets.
They have them, or think they do, and it is the intention that counts right?
I don't intend to off anyone, terrorize goverment or join the Hive. So it's no
real deal. But like, backup girl, you rambling. You are not scared.

This isn't helping. 

I've got a new family now. Not these dult husks that seems to have logged off their
brains and only run some ancient nagging script -- predictable. I mean I've
got a real living family now. They hooked me up with cool gear like this storage
chip. S556. There's more that I won't talk about. For now.

They're nice, cool and nice, my new family. They __care__ and __think__. Soon I'll
ditch my parents. Just a little more time. And. Shit, this is where it gets complex.
Like, why not let me be happy for what I've found. I discover this family, and it's
not like they're banned. Not like they're the Hive. Sure, fine, maybe my family would
be banned if people really knew. But they don't. So when I finally have a place where
I want to be. Me. Then this rando, needy and weird, dult comes out of nowhere on
the street starts asking Hive-questions, pretending to know cool, be friend, ask 
bout my new family and shit. I know your name Poo-lice!

Now I gotta ditch both Po-po and parents at the same time as I take care of some
family business, move my shit that I'm keeping. It's too much. But like there's
an alternative. There's no alternative. Either this shit pans out or I'm gonner.

Cat terminated the recording and it logged itself into the S556 chip alongside
three other files she had decided needed to be kept private. Scanning the room, her
childhood room, she was satisfied how undisturbed it looked though most items on the
packing list, __file number one__, were already removed. Twenty and one items long.
She could just as well have grabbed everything in one go; had even been ready to off 
her old self completely, parents, artifacts and all, keeping just what she were wearing.
But that was not the way, she had been told. The family had their way of doing these
things. It required patience.

Looking through her clothes, carefully reorganizing the top two drawers while removing
a black top and a generic bra. The list was more of an excercise than the collection of
most priced possessions. Some pieces evoked memories, when they were bought and
why or what had happened in them, but mostly they were just dull fabric. Just as her
life had been, dull and mostly a fabric, canvas without any paint. Perhaps these two 
items would come to mean something in days to come, but right now they were empty. 

And this room. Boring. So many hours spent here and so little personality. If she had
an external self, it sure didn't show on these walls. There were no poster of The
Tragics, which she imagine would have made here cool, but she'd never been to their 
concerts. No triple-A game poster, not even soming edgy from any of the crowdfunded
shit she had actually supported. It could as well have been a hotel room with a framed
flower or landscape painting bought at the local supermarket. There was no way the
husks would know that some items were missing if they opened the door just to check on
her. When did they do that last? Yet, if they searched with enough determination, they'd
might notice something was different. Not knowing exactly what was missing, but they'd
know that something felt wrong. Cat would be missing. Hopefully they'd notice her gone at
least. If they still had feelings and could be so jolted out of their predictable paths
around the kitchen and living room, would they do something that rash - go look through her
stuff? If they did, especially since her husks were so predictable, it would cause an
automatic flag next to her name with the athorities. And that for sure would mean her
new life had started.

The parents would struggle with attemting not to notice the difference and be terribly
conflicted, act silly in ways that would be very counter-productive. Trying to not be
worried, not be curious. She was enjoying the thought. But that was in the future.
For now, to her parents and the athorities, she still was the dull girl who almost
had decorated her room like it was a cheap hotel room.

Having a hidden agenda, a secret, and walking around with it in plain sight was
entirly new. It was a well needed practice in privacy. Dirty word. Each time she 
opened the door to leave the room it felt like a whole new world out there. And in her.

This time she would never return. Cat popped open the secret packing list.

Closing the ugly white door, she ticked off the last three items. The list had included
some mementos, some random items, some things she wanted to keep, some she hated and
some she hated that she were a bit attached to. A nod to the husks, nothing rude and
no extra affection. Out through the main door. Over. For ever.

She had been so happy lately even if things had been stressful, that she had not thought
it possible that the relief of closing the door behind her could add any more happiness.
The sigh was deep and delighted, and so surprised her that she almost forgot to keep 
moving and keep things looking very normal. That must be the hardest thing in the world,
not showing that you are happy, mad laughing happy.
