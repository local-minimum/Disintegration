# Disentigrate / Level Down

You are a cyborg and you are fragmenting with each new experience,
struggling to cope with yourself and the world. In this RPG you and the
world are both your worst enemies. As you deal with encounters, quests
and explores new areas, you become increasingly more fragmented. This
manifests itself as the world falling apart (to reach some areas you 
must also swing this to your advantage) and become increasingly more
dangerous. But if you let this go too far you will inevidately fall
through the cracks down into the void or become a victim of an all too
powerful enemy.

Healing yourself makes the world whole and safer, but healing is not
just a matter of restoring order in your brain, each time you must
disconnect the corrupting cores effectively leveling yourself down.
You choose which core stats to decrease and by this action loose
abilities and make equipment/clothing you just loved useless. As a
player you will have to carefully consider which low quality gear
to keep for the future to ensure you still have a chance to survive
when that time comes. It also makes the game less and less complex in
terms of number of abilities to choose from at any time, but also more
challenging to the player in staying alive and afloat. The enemies don't
become less frequent or easier the further into the world you get. If
anything they become more dangerous and frequent.

# Encounters

The encounter resolution has to allow for player skill as major component
in how to succeed. This can be done by reaction/stress management and learning
enemy patterns as in Dark Souls or strategy planning like XCOM.

# Story

The premise is given in terms of character motivations and setting from
the disentigrating mind and world link and the scifi theme. But the story
is still not clear. The obvious first thing to recognize that this is not
a power myth, you become weaker and weaker and therefore it focuses on
scraping by. This would lend it self to a survival or survival horror rpg,
but this too feels like missing an opportunity for the game.

The world maybe more becomes hurtful and filled with dangerous shadows
than it cracking up. It may still to some degree, but at predefined locations.

If the world is hurtful, and you hurt...
* You try to heal? 
* You run for solid ground? Home? Routine? Away?
* You run towards an explanation whichever it is.
* Someone is your nemesis. A corporate entity
* Someone is poisoning your food.
* Each new explanation adds new enemytypes.

This allows for reusing the same levels and areas multiple times as they
become more populated.

Still only build up. What is the turning point, what is the final boss?

## Endings

It could be an interesting strategy to give the story multiple endings
along the way where the player can say "This is as far as I go" or 
"I will push on even some more even though this would be good place to
settle down."

## A story about joining the collective mind

It is known that there is a collective entity out there of cyborgs who for 
unknown reasons have melded their minds together. But not much more is sure
and with so little known there's much room for speculation, cult, and fear.
Can one really know that they exist? What bodies do they posses? How does one
join, or do you forcefully get consumed? What are their motives? Are they good?
[Need to figure out their motivations though they will never be (fully)) revealed]

You are a high performing individual at the peak of your career, abilities and
sense of worth. Though, this you don't really know yet, but soon you will.
Because your future trajectory is not what it seemed to be (according to you),
nor the expected slow degeneration until death, nor the violent
curtain drop (that wouldn't make much of a story). You're at the start of a path
a fast fragmentation and disintegration of the cybernetic implants and biological
faculties, where every new impression and sensation tears a wound in your mind.
To keep sane and functioning, you are forced to shut down parts of your
extended and native brain as you tumble ahead.

You find you need to latch on to a quest, a purpose to save yourself. Both in
the sense of giving meaning to whatever still is remaining of your life and
both with the hope of saving something of you by finding a way to terminate the
process. 

And after the first moments of confusion, there appears this message from
"The Hive" as they call themselves. It is both clear, at least to you, that this
speaks directly about your predicament. Maybe directly to you. Yet at the same time
it leaves you wondering in that initial moment: "Are they enemy, did they cause this
or are they my rescue?"

[What is this in-world artifact/message that the hive has produced that fulfills
these criteria and at the same time is in line with the hive's motivations?]

And that's where you set out to find them and possibly join them or take them on
and destroy them.

[My thinking is that in the end you will get to join, still not convinced about
if they were behind it all or if they are your rescue]

### Creation myth of the hive

The most prevalent story about how the hive came to be was in a group of fringe
hardware biohackers who opposed the transparency bills of the 40ies. They were
behind some of the more spectacular hacks of our digital safety-net that monitors
everyones wellbeing and commitment to the comunity. And then they disappeared.

It could of course been a coincidence that the hive made its appearance shortly
thereafter. The hackers could just have been taken care of, and maybe the hive
was something else entirely. But there was also, or still is, the way they make
themselves known: Not by exposing their husks, as they call them, not by following
proper idea exchange protocols, but how from nowhere a new post just floats in the
air, attached with no reference of its owner or how it got there.

### Cults

It is of course rather problematic to one's social standing to show interest in
the hive as their methods of comunications and reluctance to be incorporated in
the monitoring programs makes them criminal. Which is also why they are popular
among teens.

Talking to teens is always akward, teens are akward both inwards and outwards.
But trying to talk to a teen about the hive and get something constructive back
is about as reasonable a thought as putting pineapple on a pizza.

### The ambitions of the hive.

The hive doesn't strive to opt-out of society, they've already and since long
migrated most of their existance away from the rule of law and proper order of
things. Nor are they scare for their position. They are not obviously recruiting.
If anything they are instigating revolutions. But not the large society-changing
revolutions, more the smaller ones that in hindsight might be called reformations.
You can see how this appeals to the young.

Yet in their propaganda and disobediance they still don't really seem commited.
More like if they had a stick and kept poking at where you happened to have a
blister from yesterdays exessive work-out. Saying: 

"Are you sure this is really right"
